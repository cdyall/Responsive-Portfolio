				<p>
					After 12 years of working for an engineering firm, I decided that I need to find a career that
					made me happy. I have experience within the IT industry and had great success. This lead me to
					learn a completely new yet still related skill. I decided to make a quick and drastic change by
					going back to
					school. </p>

				<br>

				<p>
					In choosing to return to school, I had to think about more than myself. I needed to make sure
					that I could learn and work simultaneously. I was very happy to find the Rutgers Coding Boot
					Camp. </p>
